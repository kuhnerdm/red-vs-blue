# Gameplay

The goal of this game is to be the last man standing amongst several AI-controlled enemies of Red and Blue varieties. The twist is that you switch teams every ten seconds. Attempting to kill an enemy on your team spawns a new enemy. You must find creative ways to eliminate all enemies in the level.

This game was created and submitted to Ludum Dare 35, with the theme "Shapeshift."
